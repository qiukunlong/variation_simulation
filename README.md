## mvsc : a multi-variation simulator of cancer genome

MVSC is a tumor variation simulation tool which involves single nucleotide polymorphism, indel, and complex structural variation (SV).MVSC can be easily operated, and multi-variation can be simulated simultaneously. The simulated original sequence can be as small as a mega base order or as large as a whole genome, a segment of DNA from reference sequence (e.g., hg19) greater than 20 Mbp in size used as input would be OK.In MVSC, users can input an exotic sequence for insertion.With this feature,MVSC can be used to perform sequence fusion of different species or virus integration simulations. In each simulation stage, MVSC output a target genome and three different types of variation information, SNP, indel, and SV. All kinds of variations are recorded separately for different uses and format described in detail is in the supplementary material. The variations of the three different output stages can be used to analyze downstream single sample; however, these variations are most applicable for case-control detection studies on cancer-specific variations.
